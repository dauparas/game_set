# game_set
Pictures of all the cards in the game Set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) cropped to 160x100 pixels. This dataset can be used to teach computer to play this game. We would like a computer to tell if there is a set on the table and which cards form a set. This task could be connected to the Deep Sets paper (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets.pdf).

The picture named pqrs.jpg means
p = number of objects;
q = shading;
r = color;
s = shape;
