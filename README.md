# game_set
This is a little project to create a program which can play the game Set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)). This task could be connected to the Deep Sets paper (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets.pdf) because the answer is the set of cards in any order.

The dataset has 81 pictures cropped to 160x100 pixels.

The picture named pqrs.jpg means
p = number of objects;
q = shading;
r = color;
s = shape;
